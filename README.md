# N-Queens-Problem-Solver
Place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
This project solves the problem using multiple algorithms, including DFS with Backtracking, BFS, Hill Climbing, and a Genetic Algorithm.
Each algorithm demonstrates a different approach to finding valid solutions efficiently.
